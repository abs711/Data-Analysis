In this work, we develop an algorithm that predicts the quality of red wines from a series of chemical measurements. We train two predictors using Kernel Ridge Regression with Gaussian and Laplacian kernels and compare them to a baseline linear regressor.

Details are presented in 'QualifyingRedWine.pdf'.
