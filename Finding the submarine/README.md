In this work, we design an algorithm to track a moving submarine, by detecting the signature acoustic signal it emits. The signature frequency is unknown, thus the algorithm first determines that. Then, the uncharacteristic frequencies are filtered out from the signal and the filtered signal is used to detect the location of the submarine. Details are presented in 'FindingtheSubmarine.pdf'.
