In this work, we group politicians based on their voting records using spectral clustering. We construct a graph with edge weights signifying closeness of pairs of data points. Then, we
cluster points using the second eigenvector of the graph Laplacian.
We also investigate the possibility of generating class labels for unlabelled samples in the data by combining clustering and a classifier learned using the labelled subset of the data.
