In this work, we investigate the compressibility of a given image using discrete cosine
transform (DCT). We also use the observation that the DCT transform of our image is sparse,
to test an image recovery method from limited random observations of its pixel. We test image
recovery for different number of random samples of pixels from the image. We then test the method
for recovery of an unknown image from limited random measurements.
